Assetto Corsa App/Mod

FCW (Front Collision Warning) is a vehicle safety feature that uses sensors to detect the distance between your car and the vehicle in front of you. If the system determines that a collision is likely, it will alert the driver through visual and audible warnings. The FCW system does not automatically brake the vehicle.

Visual and audible warnings are similar to those on the BMW iDrive 6.
More sets of visual and audible warnings, depending on the car brand and model, will be added in the future.
